            <h2>The AI Revolution: From Entertainment to Politics</h2>
            <p>WOODBURY, Minn. â€” As Dr. Manjeet Rege sat at his kitchen table, he flashed a slight grin as he watched an AI-generated video of Donald Trump and Elon Musk dancing to 'Stayin' Alive.'</p>
            <p>"Shows you the power of AI," Rege said. "And it shows you some amazing dance moves."</p>
            <p>The video, shared to X by Trump Thursday, has racked up 43.2 million views as of Friday afternoon. "Is this real?" reads a top comment.</p>

            <h2>The Rise of Generative AI</h2>
            <p>"If the 2016 election was the 'social media' election, the 2024 election can be termed the 'AI' election," Rege said.</p>
            <p>Rege directs the Center for Applied Artificial Intelligence and teaches on AI at the University of St. Thomas. He highlights how generative AI, like ChatGPT, has evolved since its release in 2022, making it easier to create realistic content.</p>
            <p>"Generative AI has really picked up, to a point where you don't need to be advanced in terms of AI knowledge to create content that looks very, very realistic," Rege said.</p>

            <h2>AI in Politics: The Good and The Bad</h2>
            <p>AI's influence in American politics is already visible. While some use it for positive purposes, like crafting policies that reflect constituents' concerns, others spread misinformation. For instance, a user on X posted an AI-generated photo of a crowd, falsely claiming it was from a Kamala Harris rally.</p>
            <p>"That's a great example of disinformation," Rege said. "This is where I think we need better regulation."</p>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>The Need for Regulation and Media Literacy</h2>
            <p>Rege notes the disagreements between the Federal Election Commission and Federal Communications Commission on AI regulation. Despite President Joe Biden's October 2023 executive order aiming to curb malicious AI use, he believes self-regulation by social media platforms may be insufficient.</p>
            <p>"Social media companies want more content to spread. They want people to log on. If you leave it to them to put in restrictions and it's more of an honor system, not enough might be done," Rege said.</p>
            <p>As the 2024 election approaches, media literacy becomes crucial to combat misinformation. With AI's advancements, even the trained eye may struggle to discern real from fake, potentially influencing voter decisions in critical moments.</p>
